I was sitting like this in a queue at a veterinary clinic. I had a phone with me with [the Notion app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/notion/id475820434) for music notation (not advertising). I wrote a simple piece with my finger on the phone, which, however, is not so easy to play.

Actually, I don't understand cats well, but I came to the clinic with a dog (I have two of them, by the way). But the music was conceived as an advertisement for cat food. Although one of my good friends said that this is more suitable for a cat litter: the theme is too tense.

Check out the score, it is [here](/ru/blog/cats-piano-song/Cats-Song.pdf).
