How not to stick to neighboring, incorrect keys when playing at a fast pace? In other words, how to stop missing and start hitting 100% of the time?

## It is not necessary to miss

To begin with, it is necessary to admit to ourselves that we have resigned ourselves; we assume as the norm: here and there some percentage of notes will be lost during the playing, the accuracy will be reduced. We cannot even contemplate the fact that absolute accuracy is still possible. We try to play as cleanly as possible, but we do not have the idea of absolute clearness, although, for the most part, the problem of incorrect (or parasitic) notes is one of the most important in working on the technique.

Nevertheless, we still strive for the clarity of the playing. In moments of enlightenment, we slow down the tempo and try to "play all the notes". True, the exposure is not enough for long, we start to return to a fast pace too early and the accuracy decreases again.

But we were going the right way! The important idea is that when we play slowly, a choice becomes available to consciousness. The accuracy of the hit becomes not an accident, but the result of a conscious choice. So we come to the conclusion that it is absolutely not necessary to miss, at least at a slow pace.

## Fast movement is a different movement

Unfortunately, the construction of a fast movement will always be different from a slow one; in other words, a fast movement is not a simple acceleration of a slow one. It is not necessary to miss at a slow pace, but in a fast one the work should be built more cunningly. The choice is no longer available to consciousness, it is necessary to act without hesitation: a kind of "pre-election campaign" should already be carried out, the necessary feelings of accuracy should light up even **before** we start playing.

Presentiment, pre-correction of movement is called scientifically **anticipation**. If you think about it, an act of faith is based on anticipation: we really, as it were, make a leap into the abyss without insurance, and only an inner sense of confidence gives us hope for a favorable outcome.

## A playing with anticipation is a playing with risk

Precisely because anticipation is an act of faith, a movement made at a fast pace does not need to be hindered by lining yourself with straws. Accuracy should be built into it initially, and the movement itself should proceed automatically. Where does this confidence come from? Of course, from a slow tempo, but not only: you can (and should) practice accuracy at a fast tempo, training the range and speed of anticipation.

The speed of anticipation is the speed of the appearance of a premonition before the start of a real movement. The range is how wide the coverage of the perceived movement is in time, that is, how far we are ready to jump with a "leap of faith", being firmly confident in the accuracy and clarity of hits. As a rule, the range indicator is not very large and covers one or two musical motifs or phrases.

## Systematic precision training

Due to the fact that the range of anticipation usually covers small fragments of music, it is reasonable to train the accuracy of fast movements by playing the passage in pieces. The most important point here is the feeling of confidence preceding the movement, the feeling of the inevitability of hitting the right notes, as if the automatic movement of the hands along a kind of rut. The task of a slow tempo is to make a choice of the right notes; the task of a fast tempo is to make a leap of faith based only on one's intuition and knowledge, without making any choice at the same time (after all, it has already been made).
