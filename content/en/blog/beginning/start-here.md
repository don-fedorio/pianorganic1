Hello everyone! I finally launched a website. Let's start with the fact that it will be just a blog, although I would like to make something bigger out of it: add some interesting sections, maybe even create a forum one day. Do you remember the forums? Welcome to 2007.

The Pianorganic project was conceived as a collection and systematization of data, a search for the principles of organic piano playing; organic means, if possible, filled with pleasant sensations, a sense of inner lightness and strength, inspiration from the development of their own skills.

The data are taken from the experience of introspection, communication with musicians, reading literature and working with students. Additional information can be found in my [telegram channel](https://t.me/pianorganic) or on my YouTube channel (so far, at the time of writing this post, only [an illustrated journal of tonalities](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiPBIFBFkxDacbGmvnoVptg0QR4JGLEFS) for teachers of solfeggio is available there and [some of my compositions](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiPBIFBFkxDamYUMr85GYMVMq0gTF5FhA). The journal of tonalities itself is [here](/ru/blog/beginning/solfege.pdf)).

Welcome!
